The essential components are (i) (provably) rapidly convergent global reduced-basis approximations—Galerkin projection onto a space WN spanned by solutions of the governing partial differential equation at N selected points in parameter space; (ii) a posteriori error estimation—relaxations of the error-residual equation that provide inexpensive yet sharp and rigorous bounds for the error in the outputs of interest; and (iii) off-line/on-line computational procedures methods which decouple the generation and projection stages of the approximation process. The operation count for the on-line stage in which, given a new parameter value, we calculate the output of interest and associated error bound, depends only on N (typically very small) and the parametric complexity of the problem; the method is thus ideally suited for the repeated and rapid evaluations required in the context of parameter estimation, design, optimization, and real-time control. }",

abstract="Recent interest in complex and computationally expensive machine learning models with many hyperparameters, such as automated machine learning (AutoML) frameworks and deep neural networks, has resulted in a resurgence of research on hyperparameter optimization (HPO). In this chapter, we give an overview of the most prominent approaches for HPO. We first discuss blackbox function optimization methods based on model-free methods and Bayesian optimization. Since the high computational demand of many modern machine learning applications renders pure blackbox optimization extremely costly, we next focus on modern multi-fidelity methods that use (much) cheaper variants of the blackbox function to approximately assess the quality of hyperparameter settings. Lastly, we point to open problems and future research directions.",

Sophisticated Bayesian optimization methods have recently achieved considerable successes in optimizing these hyperparameters, in several cases surpassing the performance of human experts. However, blind reliance on such methods can leave end users without insight into the relative importance of different hyperparameters and their interactions. This paper describes efficient methods that can be used to gain such insight, leveraging random forest models fit on the data already gathered by Bayesian optimization. We first introduce a novel, linear-time algorithm for computing marginals of random forest predictions and then show how to leverage these predictions within a functional ANOVA framework, to quantify the importance of both single hyperparameters and of interactions between hyperparameters. We conducted experiments with prominent machine learning frameworks and state-of-the-art solvers for combinatorial problems. We show that our methods provide insight into the relationship between hyperparameter settings and performance, and demonstrate that—even in very high-dimensional cases—most performance variation is attributable to just a few hyperparameters.}

They are, on the one hand, classes of real functions defined by variation diminishing kernels and similar classes of analytic functions, and, on the other hand, classes of functions in a Hilbert space which are elliptical cylinders or generalized octahedra. This second case is surveyed and new results are presented. For n-widths of ellipsoids, elliptic cylinders, and generalized octahedra, upper bounds for the n-widths are based on the Fourier method. The lower bounds are based on the method of “embedded balls” for ellipsoids and the method of averaging for generalized octahedra. General theorems concerning elliptical cylinders and generalized octahedra are proved, various corollaries from these general theorems are considered, and some additional problems (average n-widths, extremal spaces for an ellipsoids and octahedra, etc.) are discussed.}

While recent approaches use Bayesian optimization to adaptively select configurations, we focus on speeding up random search through adaptive resource allocation and early-stopping. We formulate hyperparameter optimization as a pure-exploration non-stochastic infinite-armed bandit problem where a predefined resource like iterations, data samples, or features is allocated to randomly sampled configurations. We introduce a novel algorithm, Hyperband, for this framework and analyze its theoretical properties, providing several desirable guarantees. Furthermore, we compare Hyperband with popular Bayesian optimization methods on a suite of hyperparameter optimization problems. We observe that Hyperband can provide over an order-of-magnitude speedup over our competitor set on a variety of deep-learning and kernel-based learning problems.},
